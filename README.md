# Health-Behavior-Change-Tracker
Health Behavior Change Tracker helps individuals assess and track their health behavior change journey. Using self-efficacy and stages of change models, it measures confidence, current stage, and physical activity levels (via the Exercise Vital Sign). Personalized feedback guides users toward sustained, positive health changes.
